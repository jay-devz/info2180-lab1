        <h2>Jade Palmer</h2>
        <p>I'm Jade, currently doing 4 years to get a BSc. in Molecular Biology with a minor in Computer Science. I'm interested 
            in all things software and web but I chose CS instead of SWEN because CS is a good base for bioinformatics and also 
            CS gives me more room to do SWEN courses as electives. I'm only doing 33 credits from Computing in level 2 and 3. 
            But so far I'm enjoying these courses and I think they are a good balance to my biochem courses. 
            I also like Zuko from Avatar the Last Airbender... :]
