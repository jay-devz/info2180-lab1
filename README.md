## Branching

Branching is a way to have multiple versions of the same product without causing conflicts. This is 
especially useful on group projects since sometimes one person may solve a problem one way or make 
a bug and we don't want THEIR bug affecting the entire problem or for different solutions to be causing conflicts in the code.
